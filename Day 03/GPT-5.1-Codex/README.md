# Day 03 - GPT-5.1-Codex

This folder holds the GPT-5.1-Codex implementation for Day 03. The solver reads the shared `input.txt`, `puzzle.txt`, `sample.txt`, and `sample.expected.txt` from the parent directory, validates the sample, and then solves the real input. Build and run with `dotnet run -c Release` from inside this folder.
