# Day Template

This `_template` folder contains a ready-to-copy project you can use to create each day's folder.

Files in the template:
- `puzzle.txt` is required in each day's folder and must NOT be parsed by the program. It is the official puzzle text.
- `input.txt` is required and contains your personal puzzle input.
- `sample.txt` optional; if present the harness runs it before the real input.
- `sample.expected.txt` optional; if present you can use it to hold the expected output for the sample.
- `DayTemplate.csproj` and `Program.cs` are the .NET project and template solver.
- `run.ps1` builds and runs the project in PowerShell.

Important:
- The template's `Program.cs` contains a placeholder `REPLACE_WITH_MODEL_NAME` in a `Generated by:` line. The agent must hard-code the model name used into the generated solution before delivering it (do not rely on environment variables for this). This is to make the `Generated by` attribution explicit and immutable in the day's code.

To create a new day:
1. Copy this folder and rename to `Day XX`.
2. Put the puzzle text in `puzzle.txt`, your input in `input.txt`, and optional sample files in `sample.txt` / `sample.expected.txt`.
3. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_MODEL_NAME` in `Program.cs` with the model name used for generating the solution.
4. Implement the day's `Solve` logic inside `Program.cs` (return a single string result).
5. Run with `.\run.ps1` from the day's folder.
