kingofzeal: Use the instructions. Lets solve Day 2.

GitHub Copilot: I'll solve Day 2 following the instructions. Let me start by reading the necessary files and creating a new implementation. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/input.txt)

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/sample.txt)

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/sample.expected.txt)

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/_template/Program.cs)

Now I'll create a new implementation for Day 2. Let me create the folder structure and implement the solution based on the puzzle requirements. 

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/Claude%20Sonnet%204.5)

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/Claude%20Sonnet%204.5/Day02.csproj)

Now I'll create the Program.cs with the solution logic: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/Claude%20Sonnet%204.5/Program.cs)

Now let me run the solution to verify it works correctly: 

Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 02\Claude Sonnet 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

Perfect! The solution is working correctly. Let me create a README to document this implementation: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2002/Claude%20Sonnet%204.5/README.md)

Excellent! Day 2 has been successfully solved. 

## Summary

✅ Created implementation in `Day 02\Claude Sonnet 4.5`
✅ Sample validation passed
✅ **Part 1 answer**: 40398804950
✅ **Part 2 answer**: 65794984339
✅ Processing time: ~200ms

The solution correctly identifies invalid product IDs by checking for repeating digit patterns:
- **Part 1**: Sequences repeated exactly twice (like 11, 6464, 123123)
- **Part 2**: Sequences repeated at least twice (like 111, 12341234, 1212121212)

Made changes.
