# Day 01 - GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini

This folder holds the GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini implementation for Day 01. The solver reads from the shared `input.txt`, `puzzle.txt`, `sample.txt`, and `sample.expected.txt` in the parent directory before validating samples and solving the real input. Run the solution with `.\run.ps1` from inside this folder, which builds the project in Release mode and executes it.
