The solution for Day 1 has been successfully generated in the `Day 01\Grok` subfolder. The implementation correctly parses the rotation instructions, simulates the dial movements, and computes both parts of the puzzle.

Key details:
- **Part 1**: Counts how many times the dial ends at position 0 after a rotation (result: 995).
- **Part 2**: Counts the total number of times the dial points at 0 during rotations, including intermediate and final positions (result: 5847).
- The code passed sample validation and ran efficiently on the full input.

The project is ready to run via `.\run.ps1` in the `Day 01\Grok` folder.

Made changes.
