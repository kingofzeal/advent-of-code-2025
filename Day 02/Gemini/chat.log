Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 02\Gemini'; dotnet run -c Release

I have implemented the solution for Day 2.

**Summary of changes:**
1.  Created `Day 02/Gemini` folder.
2.  Extracted the sample input and expected output from `puzzle.txt` into `Day 02/sample.txt` and `Day 02/sample.expected.txt`.
3.  Created `Day 02/Gemini/Day02.csproj` and `Day 02/Gemini/Program.cs`.
4.  Implemented the logic for finding invalid IDs based on the rules for Part 1 (repeated twice) and Part 2 (repeated at least twice).
5.  Verified the solution against the sample data.

**Results:**
-   **Part 1**: 40398804950
-   **Part 2**: 65794984339

You can run the solution yourself with:
```powershell
cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 02\Gemini'
dotnet run -c Release
cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 02\Gemini'
dotnet run -c Release


Made changes.
