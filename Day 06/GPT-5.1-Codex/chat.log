**Day 06 Update**
- Added `Day 06/GPT-5.1-Codex/Day06.csproj` and README.md, plus a fresh Program.cs attributed to GPT-5.1-Codex (Preview), giving this day its own runnable project scaffold.
- Implemented the solver in `Day 06/GPT-5.1-Codex/Program.cs`: it builds a padded char grid of the worksheet, finds contiguous non-empty column blocks (individual problems), and evaluates each twice—first by reading rows top-to-bottom for Part 1, then by reading columns right-to-left with digits stacked top→bottom for Part 2. All arithmetic uses `BigInteger` to avoid overflow, and helpers ensure operators and numbers are extracted robustly even with irregular spacing.
- Reporting grand totals from the actual input: Part 1 = `6957525317641`, Part 2 = `13215665360076`.

**Tests**
- `dotnet run -c Release` (from `Day 06/GPT-5.1-Codex`): sample validation passes and puzzle input produces the totals above.
