kingofzeal: Day 5. Make your own solution as directed. Don't look at any other solutions.

GitHub Copilot: I'll solve Day 5 by creating my own implementation. Let me start by reading the necessary files and understanding the problem. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2005/input.txt#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2005/sample.txt)

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2005/sample.expected.txt)

Good! Now I understand the problem:
- **Part 1**: Count how many of the available ingredient IDs fall within any of the fresh ID ranges
- **Part 2**: Count the total number of unique IDs covered by all the fresh ID ranges (ignoring the available IDs list)

Let me check the template and create my solution: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/_template/Program.cs#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Now let me create the Self solution folder and implement the solution: 

Ran terminal command: New-Item -Path 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5' -ItemType Directory -Force

Ran terminal command: Copy-Item 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\_template\*' -Destination 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5' -Recurse

Ran terminal command: Rename-Item -Path 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5\DayTemplate.csproj' -NewName 'Day05.csproj'

Now let me implement the solution for Day 5: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2005/Claude%20Sonnet%204.5/Program.cs)

Now let's run the solution to see if it works: 

Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

I see the issue! The input parsing is splitting on empty lines, but `Split` with `RemoveEmptyEntries` removes blank lines entirely. Let me fix this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

Ah, I see the issue - when parsing available IDs, it's trying to parse range lines as IDs. I need to be more careful. Let me fix this properly: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

Hmm, looks like there's still an issue with the parsing. Let me debug by looking at the sample file again: 

Ran terminal command: Get-Content 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\sample.txt' | ForEach-Object { "[" + $_ + "]" }

Good, the sample looks correct. The issue is that when I split on '\r' and '\n', it's creating separate entries. I should split on "\r\n" as a single delimiter. Let me trace through what should happen:

- Ranges: 3-5, 10-14, 16-20, 12-18
- Available IDs: 1, 5, 8, 11, 17, 32
- Part 1: ID 5 (in 3-5), ID 11 (in 10-14), ID 17 (in both 16-20 and 12-18) = 3 fresh
- Part 2: Merged ranges should give 3,4,5,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 = 14 total

Let me rewrite the parsing logic more carefully: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 05\Claude Sonnet 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

Perfect! The solution works correctly. It successfully:

1. **Part 1**: Counted 775 fresh ingredient IDs from the available list (matching the expected answer from puzzle.txt)
2. **Part 2**: Calculated 350,684,792,662,845 total unique IDs covered by all the fresh ingredient ID ranges

The solution uses:
- Proper parsing of the two-section input format (ranges, then available IDs)
- For Part 1: Checks each available ID against all ranges to see if it's fresh
- For Part 2: Merges overlapping ranges to avoid double-counting, then sums the total IDs in the merged ranges

The solution runs in under 3.3 milliseconds and validates correctly against the sample input.

Made changes.
