kingofzeal: Day 4!

GitHub Copilot: I'll solve Day 4 of Advent of Code 2025. Let me first read the template and existing files to understand the structure, then implement the solution. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/_template/Program.cs#1-1), lines 1 to 100

I have all the information I need. Let me create the solution for Day 4. The puzzle is about:

1. **Part 1**: Find rolls of paper (`@`) that have fewer than 4 adjacent rolls in the 8 surrounding positions
2. **Part 2**: Iteratively remove accessible rolls until no more can be removed, counting the total removed 

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2004/Claude%20Opus%204.5/Day04.csproj)

Created [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2004/Claude%20Opus%204.5/Program.cs)

Now let me run the solution: 

Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 04\Claude Opus 4.5'; dotnet run -c Release

Day 4 is solved! 🎄

**Results:**
- **Part 1: 1409** - The number of paper rolls that can be accessed by forklifts (those with fewer than 4 adjacent rolls)
- **Part 2: 8366** - The total number of rolls that can be removed by iteratively removing accessible rolls until none remain accessible

**Solution approach:**
1. **Part 1**: Scan the grid for all `@` characters, count their 8 neighbors, and mark as accessible if they have fewer than 4 adjacent rolls
2. **Part 2**: Repeatedly find all accessible rolls, remove them from the grid, and count the total removed until no more rolls are accessible

Made changes.
