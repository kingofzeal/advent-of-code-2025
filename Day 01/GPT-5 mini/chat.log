kingofzeal: Day 1 is up. Follow the instructions to generate a solution to both parts of the puzzle.

GitHub Copilot: I'll list plan steps then open `Day 01/Program.cs` and `puzzle.txt`, implement solver, and run the project's `run.ps1` to verify output. I'll mark tasks as I go.

I'll start by reading `Program.cs`, `puzzle.txt`, and `input.txt`.

Read [](file:///c%3A/src/advent-of-code-2025/Day%2001/input.txt#1-1), lines 1 to 400

Now I'll update Program.cs to implement the day-1 solver and set `GeneratedBy` to `GPT-5 mini`. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Now I'll run the project's `run.ps1` to build and execute the solver. 

Ran terminal command: cd 'c:\src\advent-of-code-2025\Day 01'; .\run.ps1

Starting: *Report results* (4/4)

**Progress update:** Implemented Day 01 solver, ran the project, and have results.

**What I changed**
- Edited `Day 01/Program.cs`:
  - Implemented the Day 1 solver in `Solve(string input)` for both parts.
  - Replaced the `GeneratedBy` placeholder with `GPT-5 mini`.

**How the solver works (brief)**
- Starts dial at `50`.
- Part 1: counts times dial equals `0` at the end of a rotation.
- Part 2: counts times the dial points at `0` during any click while rotating (including intermediate passes). The implementation computes how many times the rotation passes position `0` without simulating each click, handling large distances using division by `100`.

**Run results**
- I built and ran the `Day 01` project using the included `run.ps1`.
- Output:
  - Part 1: 995
  - Part 2: 5847
- Elapsed: ~00:00:00.0146
- Generated by: GPT-5 mini

**Files edited**
- `Day 01/Program.cs`

**Next steps / Options**
- Run again with `sample.txt` placed in `Day 01` to validate sample behavior automatically.
- Add `sample.expected.txt` to enforce sample validation.
- Commit the changes (I can create a git commit for you if you'd like).

Would you like me to commit the change and run any additional days?
