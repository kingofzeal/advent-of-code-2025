# Day 02 - Gift Shop - Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Solution Overview

This solution solves the Day 2 puzzle for Advent of Code 2025, which involves finding invalid product IDs based on repeating digit patterns.

### Part 1
Find IDs that are made of some sequence repeated exactly twice:
- `11` = 1 repeated twice ✓
- `6464` = 64 repeated twice ✓
- `123123` = 123 repeated twice ✓

### Part 2
Find IDs that are made of some sequence repeated at least twice:
- `11` = 1 repeated twice ✓
- `111` = 1 repeated three times ✓
- `12341234` = 1234 repeated twice ✓
- `1212121212` = 12 repeated five times ✓

## Algorithm

1. Parse the comma-separated ranges from the input
2. For each range, iterate through all IDs
3. For Part 1: Check if the ID string can be split in half with both halves identical
4. For Part 2: Check if the ID string can be composed of a pattern repeated at least twice
5. Sum all matching invalid IDs

## Results

- **Part 1**: 40398804950
- **Part 2**: 65794984339
- **Processing Time**: ~200ms
